## Pick Up - Cleaning the planet one piece of trash at a time

This code has been uipdated to represent a starting version of the fullstack website Pick Up, a website that entices
people to pick up trash as they go about their daily lives by rewarding them with points that they may redeem for gift cards. 

## Motivation

I want to make the earth a cleaner and better place. With talks of global warming swarming around us, sometimes it may feel as if we are helpless in the whole situation. Pick Up therefore strives to let individuals know that there is always something they can do to help, starting by picking up the trash they see around them. With this, I can only hope that individuals start making a habit of picking up the trash they see around them.

## Where this is now

This website has now become a full stack website, which means that individuals can click to change pages and can fill out the forms that will then process the data to populate pages. In the future I will set up user authentication and map and email APIs. 

## Running the code

To download this code to your machine, you must get the clone link at the top of the page, then execute this code in your terminal:

git clone git@github.com/user:repo

cd repo && npm install

npm start

Once an individual has cloned the repo into their own machine, if they are on the working directory of this project, they may also type 

flask run

into their terminal.

## Code structure

- All the images are in a static file
- Templates were used to create structure
- Personal styling was created with CSS
- The structure of the website was made in HTML
- All the images on the Rewards page were made with Painter Essentials 7
- Flask, MongoDB, and Jinja were used for the back end of this website
