## Pick Up - Cleaning the planet one piece of trash at a time

This code represents the dynamic prototype of the website Pick Up, a website that entices
people to pick up trash as they go about their daily lives. 

## Motivation

I want to make the earth a cleaner and better place. With talks of global warming swarming around us, sometimes it may feel as if we are helpless in the whole situation. Pick Up therefore strives to let individuals know that there is always something they can do to help, starting by picking up the trash they see around them. With this, I can only hope that individuals start making a habit of picking up the trash they see around them.

## Where this is now

At the moment, this is still simply a dynamic prototype. This means that although users can click buttons to go to diffrent pages, they are still unable to truly create an account or upload anything.

## Running the code

To run this on your local machine, you must simply click on the github.io link in the page's repo 

## Code structure

- All the images are in an image file
- Personal styling was created with CSS
- The structure of the website was made in HTML
- All the images on the Rewards page was made with Painter Essentials 7
