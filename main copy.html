                    marinas. This device pumps water into it and intercepts trash. This 
                    fairly simple device can caputure around 1.4 tons of debris each 
                    year while only having a running cost of $3 a day. </p>

                <p>This company aspires to cleanup around 50% of the trash of the 
                    Great Pacific Garbage Patch in 5 years. They are creating 
                    artificial floating coastlines in the middle of the ocean that 
                    will concentrate the plastic in order to make it easier to then 
                    pick up. This system consists of a long buoy that keeps the system 
                    afloat with a net attached beneath it that traps smaller partiles 
                    and stops them from floating under and away.</p>

                <p>5 Gyres is an organization that aspires to find solutions to the 
                    problem that is plastic. Their tactic is to use science and 
                    research as a weapon against the use of plastic. Their research 
                    on identifying plastic microbeads has influenced President Obama 
                    in signing the Microbead-Free Waters Act.</p>

                <p>The oceans cover over 70% of the Earth yet they are slowly dying 
                    due to the heavy level of pollution they are faced with. One of 
                    the most well known forms of pollution there is is trash pollution 
                    -primarily plastic- we see it covering the surface of the water, 
                    winking deep to the ocean floor, and even in our fish.</p>

                <h2>Will nature save us again?</h2>
                <p>The discovery of plastic eating bacteria has recently made 
                    headlines for one reason: could those bacterias be the solution 
                    to the widespread plastic polution we face? Well it seems that 
                    they may already be at work. Scientists were baffled by how the 
                    amount of plastic in the ocean is not equal to the amount esitmated
                    to have found itself there, it therefore seems that the bacteria is
                    already in the process of taking care of some of our plastic 
                    pollution. Scientists are therefore in the process of modyfying
                    the bacterias' enzymes in order to make them more efficient.</p>
